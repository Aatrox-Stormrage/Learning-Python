Birthday Greeting Pop-up Program, including two versions:

happy_birthday.py: Creates pop-ups with random positions and random greetings using multi-threading, and supports exiting with the spacebar.

happy_birthday_new.py: An optimized version that uses classes to encapsulate logic and controls thread stopping via events, resulting in a clearer code structure.
